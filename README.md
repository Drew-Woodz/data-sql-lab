# Data SQL Lab

A portfolio and practice lab of SQL solutions, datasets, and experiments with SQLite, DuckDB, and Postgres.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Capture SQL problem â†’ solution pairs from practice sites.

- Build small labs on schema design, transactions, indexing, and optimization.

- Explore analytics SQL patterns (window functions, recursive CTEs, time series).

- Add lightweight ETL and data engineering experiments.

- Show safe query handling and integration with Python.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash

git clone git@github.com:Drew-Woodz/data-sql-lab.git
cd data-sql-lab

```

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.10+ (for tests and integration demos)

- SQLite / DuckDB (lightweight databases, no setup needed)

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure (planned)

```graphql

datasets/        # small CSVs and example databases
fundamentals/    # schemas, constraints, indexing, transactions
analytics_sql/   # window functions, recursive CTEs, time series
optimization/    # EXPLAIN plans, query tuning
data_engineering/# ingestion, ETL, quality checks
apps/            # Python demos (SQLite + SQLAlchemy)
tests/           # pytest with DuckDB

```

## âœ… Status

Currently setting up the project structure and first exercises.
